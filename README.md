# Calculator
Basic calculator application made as an exercise in C# and WPF

Issues at the moment:

- If no operator is added the application crashes
- If no numbers are added the application crashes
- It's possible to add multiple operators, which makes the calculation as if both numbers are the first
- If adding multiple operators without entering a number, the 0 stays on the screen
